Task 1:The arrayManipulation.js file contains two functions. The processArray function takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled. The formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays, an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by processArray, and modifies each string based on its corresponding number.
Task 2:
The userInfo.js file contains the createUserProfiles function, which takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).
Task 3:This README file includes my student ID and a brief explanation of each task.
